# Quest for Everything

Quest for Everything is a scavenger hunt game for survival minecraft. The objective of the game is for the players to obtain all the items and blocks that are available in survival minecraft. There are currently a total of 1501 items and blocks that can be collected. To obtain these, players will need to explore, slay, mine and craft.

Players will track their progress using custom advancements, one for each of the available items & blocks. These advancements are split up into Sections, grouping similar items together such as all the wood items/blocks or all the wool items/blocks. On completion of all advancements in a Section a Trophy will be awarded!

Some of the advancements are shaped differently. To obtain these blocks requires either using a silk touch tool or killing an Enderman that is holding the block. 

On commencement of the game, a scoreboard will appear at the side of the screen. This tracks how many items you have and how many you have left to go. There's also a Death Counter, which can be seen by pressing the TAB key.

## How To Install

> 1) First find the right datapack you'd like (one of either the "original", "small biomes" or "stack" versions). Download it and then unzip the file.
> 2) To play the game, start by beginning to create a new minecraft world.
> 3) On the world creation screen, select the tab at the top of the screen called "More", then click the button called "Data Packs".
> 4) In this menu, click "Open Pack Folder" and copy and paste into this the unzipped "Quest For Everything" folder.
> 5) Back in the "Selecting Data Packs" menu, hover over the icon for Quest For Everything, this shows an arrow. Click this to select the datapack to be used when the world is created.
> 6) Make sure the world has "Allow Cheats" enabled.
> 7) Once you load into the world, run the command "/function qfe:master/setup" directly, or run the command "/reload" to have the command appear in chat for you to click. This will create the Q4E Starting Lobby.
> 8) If on a server, make sure that command blocks are turned on in the server configs.

If you wish to restart the game at any point run the function - "/function qfe:master/game_end/force_end" and it will reset you and send you back to the lobby to start over.

## Special Versions

There are two different special sub versions of Quest for Everything in addition to the original version of the game. The original is the basic datapack which can be used as normal in any new minecraft world on any minecraft seed.

### Small Biomes

The first special version which gives a custom world with small biomes. This means that you do not need to travel for hours to find a Jungle, Swamp, Flower Forest, etc.  

### Stack Edition

This second special version of Quest for Everything where the player will need to gain a full stack (64) of an item or block in order to complete its advancement and gain a point.

The amount you have turned in of each block/item will be displayed on each advancement.

In stack edition, items will not automatically be taken from your inventory. Instead there are two methods of turning in items:

> Using the command "/trigger submitHeldItem" will attempt to turn the item/items in your main hand.
> Using the command "/trigger submitChestItems" will locate the chest, barrel or shulker box you are currently looking at (within 10 blocks) and attempt to turn in the items from within it.

Any items that are excess will not be taken.

## Game Features

During the game setup period, the side of the screen shows certain custom Game Configs. These can be turned on or off to customise your experience:

- Announce Advancements - If OFF, any Advancements a player gets will not be announced in chat. This means that other players will not know what items/blocks a player has obtained so far.

- Keep Inventory - If ON, players will be able to keep the items in their inventory and experience levels after they die.
