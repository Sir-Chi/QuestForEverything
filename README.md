# Quest for Everything

Quest for Everything is a scavenger hunt game for survival minecraft. The objective of the game is for the players to obtain all the items and blocks that are available in survival minecraft. There are currently a total of 1169 items and blocks that can be collected. To obtain these, players will need to explore, slay, mine and craft.

Players will track their progress using custom advancements, one for each of the available items & blocks. These advancements are split up into Sections. On completion of all advancements in a Section a Trophy will be awarded!
There are dummy advancements (marked by the Barrier sign) on the end of each row of advancements, this is in order to be able to see all the items and blocks in the Sections properly. These are automatically given at the start of the game

On commencement of the game a scoreboard will appear at the side of the screen. This tracks how many items you have and how many you have left to go. There's also a Death Counter, which can be seen by pressing the TAB key.

## How To Install

> 1) First download the Datapack. You can then add this to a new minecraft world.
> 2) To play the game create a new minecraft world and add this datapack into the world's datapack folder.
> 3) Unzip the file there and then select it from the new world creation menu in the game.
> 4) Make sure the world is set to "Creative" Game Mode & has "Allow Cheats" enabled.
> 5) Once you load into the world run the command "/function qfe:master/setup" directly or run the command "/reload" to have the command appear in chat for you to click. This will create the Q4E Starting Lobby.
> 6) If on a server, make sure that command blocks are turned on in the server configs.
