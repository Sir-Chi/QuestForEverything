# Quest for Everything

Quest for Everything is a scavenger hunt game for survival minecraft. The objective of the game is for the players to obtain all the items and blocks that are available in survival minecraft. There are currently a total of 1169 items and blocks that can be collected. To obtain these, players will need to explore, slay, mine and craft.

Players will track their progress using custom advancements, one for each of the available items & blocks. These advancements are split up into Sections, grouping similar items together such as all the wood items/blocks or all the wool items/blocks. On completion of all advancements in a Section a Trophy will be awarded!
There are dummy advancements (marked by the Barrier sign) on the end of each row of advancements, this is in order to be able to see all the items and blocks in the Sections properly. These are automatically given at the start of the game

On commencement of the game, a scoreboard will appear at the side of the screen. This tracks how many items you have and how many you have left to go. There's also a Death Counter, which can be seen by pressing the TAB key.

## How To Install

> 1) First download the Datapack. Unzip the file.
> 2) To play the game, create a new minecraft world, and add this datapack into the world's datapack folder.
> 3) Select the datapack from the new world creation menu in the game.
> 4) Make sure the world is set to "Creative" Game Mode & has "Allow Cheats" enabled.
> 5) Once you load into the world, run the command "/function qfe:master/setup" directly, or run the command "/reload" to have the command appear in chat for you to click. This will create the Q4E Starting Lobby.
> 6) If on a server, make sure that command blocks are turned on in the server configs.

## Small Biomes

There are two different versions of Quest for Everything. One is the basic datapack which can be used as normal in any new minecraft world on any minecraft seed. The other is a special version which gives a custom world with small biomes. This means that you do not need to travel for hours to find a Jungle or a Swamp.  
  
If you'd like to change the seed used for generating the world in the small biomes version check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sir-Chi/QuestForEverything/wiki) which gives you a step by step guide on how to do that.

## Game Features

During the game setup period, the side of the screen shows certain custom Game Configs. These can be turned on or off to customise your experience:

- Natural Regeneration - If OFF, players will not be able to regen health. This doesn't affect external healing from things such as using the golden apple, the regeneration effect and such.
- Keep Inventory - If ON, the players will keep their items and experience after they die.
- Announce Advancements - If OFF, any advancement a player gets will not be announced in chat.
- Announce Trophies - If OFF, any trophies a player gets will not be announced in chat.
- All Recipes Unlocked - If ON, all the recipes unlocked at the start of the game for all players. If OFF, all players will gain recipes as normal just by playing the game.
- Take Items - If OFF, an item will not be taken from the player upon obtaining an item for the first time. If ON, 1 item will be taken from the player upon obtaining an item for the first time.
- One Item Per Person - If ON then everyone on a team will need to obtain every time and block individually. If OFF when one person on a team obtains an item or block it will count as if everyone on that team has obtained it.
- Set Time - You can set the game to end after a set amount of time.
- Set Score - You can set the game to end after a set amount of advancements/score has been reached.
- Teams - When teams are active, signs will appear in the Lobby giving everyone the option of joining a team. There are 8 team colours to choose from!

#### The Dragon Egg

Once one person obtains the Dragon Egg, it will give everyone else the advancement too, even if "One Item Per Person" is on.
